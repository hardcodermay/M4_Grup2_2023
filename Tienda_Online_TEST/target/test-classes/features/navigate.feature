Feature: Navigate through categories

  In order check all the products in the store and decide which one to buy
  As a user
  I want to be able to navigate through the different categories

  Scenario: User clicks every category present at Product Store website

    Given Francisco wants to check every category
    When Francisco clicks on every category one by one to see the products
    Then he can check the stock and see the first product
